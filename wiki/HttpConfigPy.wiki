#http_config.py : Standalone python HTTP daemon for learning mode !

= http_config.py =

http_config.py is a standalone HTTP server, based on BaseHTTPServer and SQLite. Its goal is to be used during the LearningMode phase, to receive the to-be-blocked requests and generate whitelists for those requests.
During the LearningMode phase, naxsi will let all requests pass, and will also forward them to the location configured by *DeniedUrl*. As you guess, you're expected to make this location point to http_config.py daemon. 

http_config.py will then receive all the to-be-blocked requests (false positives) and will generate & store whitelist rules (using BasicRule) into the SQLite database. If you fire your browser at http_config.py daemon, you be able to follow the number of exceptions (false positives) and by a simple "click", dump those rules to a predefined file (that should be included into naxsi's configuration via nginx's include directive) and issue a /etc/init.d/nginx reload.

Your configuration will be over when you did an exhaustive enough browsing session of your website (that MUST include form-filling, as it's the main source of false positives).

{{{
usage: http_config.py --rules /path/to/naxsi_core.rules [-h] [--dst DST] [--db DB] [--cmd CMD] [--port PORT]
                      [-n] [-v V]
--rules is mandatory

Naxsi's learning-mode HTTP server. Might have to be run as root (yes scarry), if you want it to be able to perform /etc/init.d/nginx reload.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --dst DST    Full path to the temp rule file. This file should be included
               in your naxsi's location configuration file. (default:
               /tmp/naxsi_rules.tmp)
  --db DB      SQLite database file to use. (default: naxsi_tmp.db)
  --cmd CMD    Command that will be called to reload nginx's config file
               (default: /etc/init.d/nginx reload)
  --port PORT  The port the HTTP server will listen to (default: 4242)
  -n           Run the daemon as non-root, don't try to reload nginx.
               (default: False)
  -v V         Verbosity level 0-3 (default: 1)
