#Naxsi Introduction.


= What is NAXSI =

Naxsi is a web application firewall for nginx.
To see the definition of web application firewall : [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Web_Application_Firewall OWASP's WAF Page]

Naxsi uses a positive approach (whitelisting), which makes him different from most firewalls. 

Naxsi aims at being fast/light/scalable, meaning it can handle a lot of traffic.

Global idea behind naxsi is :
 * Setup naxsi in [LearningMode]
 * naxsi will then learn from incoming (preferably trusted) traffic 
 * Extract whitelists generated by naxsi

Turning LearningMode on/off or reloading naxsi doesn't mean you have to lose active connections, thanks to nginx's design.

= Pros and Cons of naxsi =

Thanks to positive model, naxsi only needs to perform limited check on data, resulting in good performances.

Because of positive model, you cannot expecting setting up naxsi for a site with various user input/interaction without doing a phase in [LearningMode].
