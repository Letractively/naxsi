#Help us constructing naxsi's roadmap !

= You chose, We code  =

Yes that's it ! Naxsi has reached a point to where all known bugs and limitation have been dealt with, or are about to.

So, what's next ? Well, we have several options on what to put next on the roadmap, and we'd like to have your point of view ! (that's one of the points of open source after all)

 * Parsing outgoing page, to detect :
 # Dataleaks (/etc/passwd, PHP code ...)
 # Error triggering (SQL errors, Obvious XSS)
 # Successful attacks ("owned by" etc.)

 * Parsing more incoming requests type :
 # json
 # soap/xml
 # ...

So, what do you think ?

Please send a mail to naxsi-discuss@googlegroups.com and let us know !

Feel free to suggest more stuff as well !
