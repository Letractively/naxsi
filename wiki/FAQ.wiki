*I enabled NAXSI, but it doesn't seem to filter requests ? * 

Did you put NAXSI directives first in your location configuration ?
You *MUST* put NAXSI's directives first your location configuration.

*How to limit learning mode to some specific IPs ?*

The easiest way to do so is to rely on nginx's HttpAllowModule.
http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpAccessModule
Using this module (default in nginx), you can simply put in your location specified by DeniedUrl :

{{{
        location /RequestDenied {
                 allow 127.0.0.1;
                 allow x.x.x.x;
                 deny all;
                 proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4242/;                                                                                                               
                 }
