*I enabled NAXSI, but it doesn't seem to filter requests ? * 

Did you put NAXSI directives first in your location configuration and ./configure ?
You *MUST* put NAXSI's directives first your location configuration.

*How to limit learning mode to some specific IPs ?*

The easiest way to do so is to rely on nginx's HttpAllowModule.
http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpAccessModule
Using this module (default in nginx), you can simply put in your location specified by DeniedUrl :

{{{
        location /RequestDenied {
                 allow 127.0.0.1;
                 allow x.x.x.x;
                 deny all;
                 proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4242/;                                                                                                               
                 }

}}}



*How to test that naxsi is working ?*

Setup your RequestDenied as follow :


{{{
        location /RequestDenied {
                return 500;                                                                                                           
        }
}}}

Check that LearningMode is disabled, and issue a request like :

{{{
http:/.../?a=<>
}}}


You should get a 500 from NGINX, and get an entry in your nginx error log, in the form :


{{{
NAXSI_FMT: ....
}}}


*I downloaded / installed debian package, but I cannot find learning daemon ?*


So far, learning daemon is not included into debian package,

 so you have to download it from 

{{{
http://code.google.com/p/naxsi/downloads/list
}}}

Learning Daemon is then found in contrib/naxsi-ui/




Next release will include an "extra" package including learning daemon.


* Which version of naxsi is suitable for which nginx version ? *

All naxsi version should work on *ALL* nginx version, except very very old version (< 0.8.54).
