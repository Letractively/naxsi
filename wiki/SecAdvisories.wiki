== NO-CVE: *[Low*] SQL Injection in naxsi's nx_intercept ==
 * Rated: Low
 * Date: 2 Apr 2012
 * Affected: 0.44
 * Fixed in: 0.44-1
 * Discovered by : Naxsi dev team

Ironically, an SQL Injection is present in naxsi's _new_ python learning daemon (nx_intercept.py).
The vulnerability is rated as low, as :
 * Learning daemon is usually restricted to trusted IPs
 * No sensitive data are present into database, as it is only used to store exceptions.

The vulnerabilty only affects the nx_intercept python daemon, not the naxsi's core.
Vulnerable code is :
{{{
    if md5 is not None and ip is not None:
        cursor.execute("INSERT INTO http_monitor (peer_ip, md5) VALUES ('%s', '%s')" % (ip, md5))
        return
}}}
