#Naxsi compatibility.

== Naxsi "core" dependencies ==
  * lib pcre (naxsi sometimes on regex for pattern matching)
  * lib ssl (if you want SSL, but this is required by nginx as well)

== Naxsi http_config.py dependencies ==
  * python 2 or 3
  * python sqlite3 (you might have to change the import to sqlite2 depending on your version)
  * python hashlib
  * python urlparse / urllib
(If you are using python 3.X, use version > 0.42 as python 3 support was added here)

== Naxsi is compiling/working on ==
  * debian linux : yes
  * netbsd : to be production-proof certified, being packaged.
  * freebsd : to be production-proof certified, being packaged.

If you try naxsi on other systems / distributions, feel free to drop us a word ! 

== Testing if naxsi is working on your system ==

naxsi, as many other softwares, comes with test units. 
This allow you to perform tests onto nginx+naxsi to confirm it's working 
with your distribution/libraries versions/whatever.

These test units rely on nginx::test and prove. You will find more details if needed on this awesome blog :
