#Location where denied requests will be redirected. While in LearningMode, to-be-blocked requests will also be sent here, as well as to the original target.

= DeniedUrl =

DeniedUrl is part of naxsi's configuration. It *must* point to an existing nginx's location :
{{{
DeniedUrl "/RequestDenied";
}}}


{{{
 location /RequestDenied {
     proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4242;
   }
}}}

Blocked requests will be sent there, so feel free to put whatever you want here, from a simple 
{{{
return 403;
}}}

to a proxy_pass to your own software for NIDS / reporting features :
{{{
proxy_pass http://xx.xx.xx.xx:zz;
}}}

The request will contain the full original request, as well as some complementary information, such as details about which rule(s) matched on which part(s) of the request.
