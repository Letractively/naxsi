= Test naxsi, trust naxsi =

As a security enthusiastic, I only trust software I can test, I don't believe a wiki, and I don't think you do neither.

That's why we propose you proof by example : test naxsi !

We have set-up a dedicated box that acts as a reverse proxy (with OOB naxsi installation) to the following sites :
 * demo.testfire.net (Appscan demo site)
 * testphp.vulnweb.com (Acunetix demo site)
 * testasp.vulnweb.com (Acunetix demo site)


== Ok, how to play ? ==

Modify your /etc/hosts, and make demo.testfire.net, testphp.vulnweb.com and testasp.vulnweb.com point to 46.105.5.175

Fire your browser, play ! We can now try to exploit any of the vulnerabilities present in those sites.

== What's the goal, what can I win ? ==

Those sites present numerous "on purpose" vulnerabilities, your goal is fairly simple : exploit one of those vulnerabilities, find a way to bypass naxsi ! Help the project !

What can you win ? We'd like to offer you helicopters, trips to vegas & Disneyland, but we unfortunately cannot. If you're lucky enough to be in France/Paris, and find a bypass, I will be more than happy to offer you a beer and share results ! We will as well add your name to the wall of fame (for people helping the project by finding bypasses/vulnerabilities) !

== How to report ? I found over 9000 vulnerabilities ==

Either report an Issue on the project (via googlecode's interface), or send me an email directly !
You can also find me on irc, freenode, nickname bui.


Have fun ! Thanks !
