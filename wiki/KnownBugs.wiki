#Known bugs, we're hunting them down.

Not planned to be implemented so soon:
 * Naxsi doesn't parse JSON / XML requests. It will only parse   `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data` POST types, as well as GET requests.
 * Naxsi doesn't parse FILES in POST requests. It may be the case someday, but I feel like it's more an anti-virus job, as it would be extremly easy to bypass (within naxsi's design).

We're working on it:

 * (Expected commit apr 2012) Naxsi doesn't parse files buffered to disk by nginx. Code is being tested before integration in next release.
