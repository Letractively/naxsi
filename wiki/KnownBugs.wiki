#Known bugs, we're hunting them down.

 * Naxsi doesn't parse JSON / XML requests. It will only parse   `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` and `multipart/form-data` POST types, as well as GET requests.
 * Naxsi doesn't parse FILES in POST requests. It may be the case someday, but I feel like it's more an anti-virus job, as it would be extremly easy to bypass (within naxsi's design).
 * Naxsi doesn't parse files buffered to disk by nginx. It is something we're currently working on.
 * Naxsi suffers from hash collisions. You cannot write two on named arguments targetting the same url in the same location :
  $URL:/bla|$ARGS_VAR:blu
  $URL:/bla|$ARGS_VAR:blo
This will create a collision. This is something under work too !
