#Known bugs, we're hunting them down.

 * Just discovered that there is a bug which may lead to requests not being checked when there is rewritting. (As REWRITE PHASE is *before* ACCESS PHASE)
 * Naxsi doesn't parse JSON requests
 * Discovered that ngx_unescape_uri incorrectly handles %uff patterns, and will simply remove the '%', breaking %uff obfuscation rules.
