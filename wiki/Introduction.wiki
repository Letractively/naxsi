=What is Naxsi?=

Naxsi is an open source, high performance, low rules maintenance, Web Application Firewall module for Nginx, the infamous web server and reverse-proxy.

Its goal is to help people securing their web application against attacks such as SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting, Cross Site Request Forgery, Local & Remote file inclusions.

The difference with most WAF (Web Application Firewalls) out there is that it does not rely on signatures to detect and block attacks. It use a simpler model where, instead of trying to detect "known" attacks, it detects unexpected characters in the HTTP request/arguments. Each kind of unusual character will increase the score of the request. If the request reaches a score that's considered "too high", the request will be denied, and the user will be redirected to a "forbidden" page. Yes, it works a bit like a spam system.

=Why it is different?=

Because it works on a learning mode (read white list). Set the module in learning
mode, scroll your site, and it will generate the necessaries white lists to avoid
false positives ! Naxsi doesn't relies on pre-defined signatures, so it
should be capable of defeating complex/unknown/obfuscated attack patterns.
